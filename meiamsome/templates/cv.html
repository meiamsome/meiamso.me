<h2>About Me </h2>
<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
            From an early age, I've been a hobbyist programmer. I am currently working on obtaining my degree in Computer Science that will make it possible for me to continue to do what I love as a profession. I am involved in a few projects with friends that I manage in my free time.
            I never sit down for the full exam as I'm such a legit boss I complete even cryptography exams in half 
            the time. They say I don't know my hash functions, but I'm sure I can distinguish them even if they're collision resistant.
            The same can be said of my life really, I distinguish between good things and bad things, while they remain 
            one way, despite being in an illogical universe of existence.

        <p>
            My Role in RealGamerNewz is primarily web-based. I have coded two Wordpress Themes for RealGamerNewz as the site has developed - including the current and more responsive design. I was given a rough outline of the design and have since adapted it into its' current form. In the future I am looking to develop the theme to apply a lot more of the responsive design principles. In this position I have also programmed several custom Wordpress Plugins to add features for the RealGamerNewz' writing staff. I work on RealGamerNewz when I have free time.
